          As a kid, I often found myself on random chat rooms, even though I might come off as introverted. Those spaces were raw, chaotic, and surprisingly fun—a mix of spontaneity and connection that stuck with me. Yap is my way of bringing that experience back.

          While Yap aims to capture the spirit of those old-school chat rooms, I’ve added moderation features to make sure it stays a safe and welcoming space for everyone. Public chat rooms are actively monitored to address any unsavory behavior and keep things fun for all participants.

          Yap is about rediscovering connection and community, and I hope it becomes a place where you can let loose and enjoy the moment—just like the old days.
